# Rooms

Rooms is a matching app, that matches you to your perfect house or room. By giving your preferences in your budget and where you want to live, you get the most fitting result. After reviewing the house and information about the house, you can decide if this is the match for you!

The most important reason that Rooms is being made, is to make the process of looking for a new house easier. Because of the API's Rooms uses, and giving your own preferences, you get the most relevant searches to match with!
